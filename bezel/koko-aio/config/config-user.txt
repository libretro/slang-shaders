// THIS FILE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED IN FAVOUR OF config-user-optional.txt

// Assuming retroarch is >= 1.19,
// This file WOULD BE OVERWRITTEN by an update, so it has been deprecated
// in favour of the new config-user-optional.txt
// So my advice is to migrate the usage of config-user.txt to config-user-optional.txt
// the syntax is the same.
