// This preset/shader emulates an effect found in old or low-quality CRT displays,
// where dark tones were clipped to black as the overall image brightness increased.
// A positive "range" value will produce "crushed" blacks, causing a loss of detail
// in darker areas, while a negative value results in a more conservative adjustment
// by altering the output gamma instead.
//
// In an existing CRT shader chain, this shader should be placed just before the one
// responsible for generating the scanlines. However, similar (and less GPU-intensive)
// results can be achieved by simply placing it at the very beginning of the chain.
//
// float_framebuffer1 = "true" has been commented, because it triggers HDR on capable
// systems and may lead to washed colors when this shader is placed at the very
// end of the chain.
// On the other side, it has been reported that (depending on subsequent shaders)
// float_framebuffer1 may produce smoother transitions when this shader is placed 
// earlier in the chain.
